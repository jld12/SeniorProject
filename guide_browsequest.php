<p>The dropdown list shown above contains the name of every quest available in the database. If you know the name of the quest you want to see more information about, this method will work for you. You can also use this method to select a random quest or one with an interesting name. Once you have one selected, click the 'Search' button to the right of the dropdown. You will be taken to the quest's information page.</p><br />
<hr>
<h3>Step 3b: By zone method:</h3>

<p>If you, for example, have many client orders in a specific zone, you can search for quests by zone. Click the dropdown and select one of the zones. Once you select a zone, click the 'Search' button right next to the dropdown list. Don't see the zone you're looking for? Some quests have not been entered yet. Try again later or <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> to let me know that you want a specific zone added.</p>

<p>Once you click the 'Search' button, you will see a link to search again and a list of quest names. These are the quests in the zone you selected. Click one to go to the quest's page and see more information about it.</p><br />
