<p>On the client order's page, you can view several pieces of information about that client order, including the zone, rewards, and which NPC offers that client order. In addition, the box at the bottom of the page has a list of quests in the same zone as that client order. Clicking the NPC or a quest's name will take you to the corresponding page for the item you click.</p>
