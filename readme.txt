A CD-R (or DVD-R if necessary) of all your materials including your project code, documentation and so on.  
This CD-R must contain a file in the root directory called “readme.txt” which is a plain text file (editable 
by MS NotePad or the like) explaining the file system contents (directory structure and where files are located) 
and how to use the CD.  If your code uses a compiler not installed on Alicia’s machine, include a copy of the 
code in plain text format and/or include a printed copy of your code.
